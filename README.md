# Soroban Identity

> **Decentralized Identity for a Trustless World.**

Soroban Identity is a decentralized identity (DID) and credential management protocol built on [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/) — the smart contract platform of the Stellar network. It enables users to create, own, and manage verifiable on-chain identities linked to their wallets, while allowing applications to securely verify credentials without exposing sensitive data.

---

## Why Soroban Identity?

In the current Web3 ecosystem:

- Users lack persistent, verifiable identities
- Reputation is fragmented across platforms
- Compliance (KYC/AML) is difficult to implement in a decentralized way
- Sensitive user data is overexposed or centrally stored

Soroban Identity fixes this by providing a **privacy-preserving identity layer** that any dApp on Stellar can plug into.

---

## Core Features

**Decentralized Identity (DID)**
- Wallet-linked identity profiles using the `did:stellar:` method
- Unique on-chain identifiers, W3C DID-compatible
- Portable across multiple dApps

**Verifiable Credentials**
- KYC verification badges issued by trusted entities
- Proof of reputation, activity, or achievements
- Cryptographic attestations stored on-chain

**Privacy-Preserving Verification**
- Selective disclosure of identity data
- Permission-based access to credentials
- Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) integration — future-ready

**Reputation Layer**
- On-chain activity scoring via trusted reporters
- Anti-sybil mechanisms with configurable thresholds
- Trust signals for marketplaces, DAOs, and DeFi

## Smart Contracts

### `identity-registry`

Manages W3C-aligned DID documents on-chain.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `initialize(admin)` | One-time setup |
| `create_did(controller, metadata)` | Mint a new DID for a wallet |
| `update_did(controller, metadata)` | Update DID metadata |
| `deactivate_did(controller)` | Soft-delete a DID |
| `resolve_did(controller)` | Fetch a full DID document |
| `has_active_did(controller)` | Boolean active check |

### `credential-manager`

Issues and verifies verifiable credentials.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `initialize(admin)` | One-time setup |
| `add_issuer(issuer)` | Register a trusted issuer (admin only) |
| `remove_issuer(issuer)` | Remove an issuer (admin only) |
| `issue_credential(issuer, subject, type, claims, sig, expires)` | Issue a credential |
| `revoke_credential(issuer, id)` | Revoke a credential |
| `verify_credential(id)` | Check if a credential is valid and not expired |
| `get_credential(id)` | Fetch full credential data |

### `reputation`

On-chain activity scoring and anti-sybil layer.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `initialize(admin)` | One-time setup |
| `add_reporter(reporter)` | Register a trusted reporter (admin only) |
| `submit_score(reporter, subject, delta, reason)` | Submit a score delta |
| `get_reputation(subject)` | Get aggregated reputation record |
| `get_history(subject, reporter)` | Get score history from a reporter |
| `passes_sybil_check(subject, min_score, min_reporters)` | Anti-sybil gate |

---

## DID Format

```
did:stellar:<bech32-stellar-address>
```

Example:
```
did:stellar:GABC1234XYZ...
```

This is W3C DID-compatible and portable across any dApp that integrates the SDK.

## Credential Flow

```
Issuer                    Subject                  Verifier
  │                          │                         │
  │─── issue_credential ────▶│                         │
  │                          │──── present cred id ───▶│
  │                          │                         │─── verify_credential
  │                          │                         │◀── true / false
```

## TypeScript SDK

Install:
```bash
cd sdk && npm install
```

Usage:
```ts
import { IdentityClient, CredentialClient, ReputationClient, TESTNET_CONFIG } from "@soroban-identity/sdk";

const config = {
  ...TESTNET_CONFIG,
  identityRegistryId: "YOUR_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID",
  credentialManagerId: "YOUR_CREDENTIAL_CONTRACT_ID",
  reputationId: "YOUR_REPUTATION_CONTRACT_ID",
};

// Resolve a DID
const identity = new IdentityClient(config);
const doc = await identity.resolveDid("GABC...");

// Verify a credential
const credentials = new CredentialClient(config);
const valid = await credentials.verifyCredential("GABC...", "credential-id-hex");

// Check reputation / anti-sybil
const reputation = new ReputationClient(config);
const passes = await reputation.passesSybilCheck("GABC...", "GSUBJECT...", 50, 2);
```

## Frontend

React + Vite dApp with Freighter wallet integration.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Features:
- Connect Freighter wallet
- Resolve any DID by Stellar address
- Create your own on-chain DID
- Verify credentials by ID
- Issue credentials (registered issuers)

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) + `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli)
- Node.js 18+
- [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app) browser extension

```bash
# 1. Install Rust wasm target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 2. Build all contracts
cd contracts && cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# 3. Deploy to testnet (set your secret key first)
export STELLAR_SECRET_KEY=S...
bash scripts/deploy.sh

# 4. Install and run the frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# 5. Install and build the SDK
cd sdk && npm install && npm run build
```
